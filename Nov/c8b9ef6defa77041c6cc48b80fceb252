Pretoria - KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Arts and Culture, Bongiwe Sithole-Moloi, has congratulated Idols SA finalists Noma Khumalo and Thami Shobede for representing the province in the competition thus far. “The department commends how hard they have worked to get into the top two,” MEC Sithole-Moloi said. Khumalo hails from Pietermaritzburg, while Shobede is from Mtubatuba. “KZN is set to claim the Idols SA title again through the commitment of these two artists. We encourage people across the province to rally behind Khumalo and Shobede by voting,” she said. The provincial department said KwaZulu-Natal has proven time and again to be a diverse talent hub. “It is for this reason that the department creates platforms for local artists to hone and showcase their talents. “There are also workshops and forums aimed at training and development,” the department said.
