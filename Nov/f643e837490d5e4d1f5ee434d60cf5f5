Pretoria - A Hawks investigation has led to the arrest of a suspect and seizure of almost R5.3 million in cash. The Hawks also recovered several ID documents during the operation in Belhar, in Cape Town, on Monday. The suspect (33), who was arrested, is allegedly running an illicit licensing and police clearance operation. Acting Head of the Hawks in the Western Cape, Brigadier Mzwandile Ndlovu, praised the members for the arrest. “This is undoubtedly a telling blow to the underworld, we remain unequivocal in the fight against organized crime as it ranks very high in our mandate,” Ndlovu said. The suspect is expected to appear in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday facing money laundering, corruption and racketeering. Police say they are continuing with the investigations as the possibilities of more arrests cannot be ruled out. – SAnews.gov.za
