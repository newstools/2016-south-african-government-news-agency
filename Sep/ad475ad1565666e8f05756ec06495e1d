Pretoria - The Portfolio Committee on Police wants Eastern Cape Police Commissioner Liziwe Ntshinga and the Port Elizabeth (PE) cluster management to urgently intervene at the New Brighton police station. “It is apparent that there is a serious management challenge with detective services at New Brighton police station. This does not bode well for crime prevention and the ability to police the area. “The committee accepts that some of the issues are structural and beyond the police’s competences,” committee chair Francois Beukman said. The committee visited New Brighton police station on Thursday. The policing area includes approximately 130 000 residents and yet the station only has two informants. Other challenges include poor street lighting, poor house numbering in informal settlements, a shortage of vehicles, confidentiality and office space for detectives, language barriers and poor handling of dockets. Beukman said the Provincial Commissioner and the Cluster Commander should make sure that there is an improvement of detective services. “The committee is concerned about the increase in contact crimes and serious crimes. But equally concerning is the lack of employment of informants as well as the handling of dockets and other evidence materials at the station,” he said. The committee is today expected to visit the KwaZakhele police station and other police stations in the area. – SAnews.gov.za
