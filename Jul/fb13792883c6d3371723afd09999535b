Pretoria - The Hawks have arrested a 44-year-old medical doctor in Polokwane for fraud, forgery and theft. The suspect, who was arrested on Monday at his workplace in Rethabile Clinic, was fraudulently purchasing a prescription drug for more than two years. “The doctor allegedly acquired morphine since 2015 using another doctor’s stamp, a forged signature and the letterhead from the provincial Department of Health,” Hawks provincial spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke said. Maluleke said before being led to the police cells, police searched the suspect’s house and seized 35 bottles containing ARV tablets, doctor’s stamps and other items believed to have been stolen from the Department of Health. The doctor is expected to make his first appearance at the Mankweng Magistrate’s Court today. - SAnews.gov.za
