Pretoria – South Africa is committed to aligning itself with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Climate Change Agreement, says Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa. The goals includes a set of 17 SDGs to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice, as well as tackle climate change by 2030. Speaking in New York on Thursday, Minister Molewa said South Africa’s National Development Plan (NDP) is in line with both the SDGs and Africa’s Agenda 2063. “Implementation is therefore already well underway and is focused on addressing the triple challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment,” she said. Minister Molewa was addressing the President of the United Nations General Assembly’s high level event on SDGs. “Our collective achievement of the SDGs presents a unique challenge within the next 14 years to ensure more sustainable livelihoods for billions of people, particularly for women and youth, who continue to carry a disproportionate burden brought about by poverty, unemployment and inequality,” she said. Minister Molewa welcomed the integration of women in nearly all the goals as it raises the importance of Gender Equality. “What we need to do now is to enhance the basis for rapid progress, through stronger laws, policies and institutions, better data and scaled-up financing for sustainable development initiatives by women,” she said. – SAnews.gov.za
