Pretoria – Cabinet has encouraged prospective and current service providers to register on the Central Supplier Database (CSD), which is aimed at enabling especially small businesses to exploit economic opportunities and contribute to the development of South Africa’s economy. This was said by Minister in the Presidency for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, Jeff Radebe, at a post Cabinet briefing held in Pretoria, on Thursday. The CSD is a source of all supplier information for all spheres of government. “The purpose of centralising government’s supplier database is to reduce duplication of effort and cost for both supplier and government while enabling electronic procurement processes. “In better enabling small businesses, National Treasury and the Black Business Council established a centre which will assist small businesses with registration on the CSD, e-tender queries and other client services of National Treasury,” he said. - SAnews.gov.za
