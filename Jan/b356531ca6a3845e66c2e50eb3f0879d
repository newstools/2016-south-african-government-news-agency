Pretoria – Rural Development and Land Reform Minister Gugile Nkwinti has distanced himself from four Facebook accounts, which were falsely opened in his name. The department has warned the public against engaging with these social media accounts that contain various posts, comments and photographs attributed to the Minister. Minister Nkwinti has called on South Africans, who have engaged on the Facebook pages, to be aware that the views and comments are of faceless individuals and not those of the Minister. The department has urged individuals who have fraudulently established the accounts in the name of the Minister and who continue to write comments and post photographs on these pages to refrain from doing so. Minister Nkwinti has never had personal Facebook or Twitter accounts. – SAnews.gov.za
