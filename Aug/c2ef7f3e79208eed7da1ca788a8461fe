Pretoria - The Gauteng Department of Education says it is currently in the process of placing learners who applied online and anticipates it will conclude the process by 7 September 2016. The department launched the online application for the 2017 academic year targeting Grades 1 and 8. The online application system closed on the 1 June 2016. Briefing the media on the status of Admissions Online Applications on Monday, Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi noted that out of 129 759 offers of placement, only 56 844 learners (35 617 Grade 1 and 21 227) have been placed in various schools. “That means only 44% of all applications for Grade 1 and 8 have been placed, while 72 347 (41 412 Grade 1 and 30 935 Grade 8) are still pending confirmations by parents. To date 63% or 1 306 schools have successfully placed learners for the 2017 academic year. MEC Lesufi said the pace of placement is moving slower than anticipated, partly due to parents not confirming offers. “Another challenge is that the online applications for Grade 1 and 8 is 51% of current enrolment. That may mean poor response by parents to apply for their children in some areas.” MEC Lesufi said 29 575 (16 363 Grade 1 and 13 212 Grade 8) applicants registered after the closing date will only receive offers of placement after all applicants, who applied before the closing date, are placed. The MEC urged parents to confirm acceptance or reject offers of placement either on the Admissions Online Application or by visiting schools, where assistance will be provided. He warned that failure to respond will result in parents forfeiting their offers of placement and causes further placement delays. “Parents who still have problems with placement outcomes may object to the district directors by completing an Objection Form (Annexure D). The Objection Form, which is obtainable from the school or the district office, must be submitted to the relevant district office for processing. “Parents, who have not yet made applications for admission for the 2017 learner intake, are encouraged to apply online or to go to the relevant district, where assistance will be provided. Late applications will be placed by 16 November 2016. This will allow the department to provide schools with the necessary resources,” Lesufi said. He reiterated that no admissions will be processed in January 2017. The department will provide parents with unplaced learners an opportunity to resolve queries in the four regions (Tshwane, Sediwest, Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg) at the regional admissions open days between the months of October and November 2016. “It is important to underline that the Constitutional Court ruling on Admissions Regulations does not mean parents can now take their children to any school of their choice. “The current feeder zone policy is still in effect until replaced by a new policy to be ratified by the Constitutional Court. The outcome of the public consultation will be submitted to the Gauteng Exco for approval,” the MEC said. – SAnews.gov.za
