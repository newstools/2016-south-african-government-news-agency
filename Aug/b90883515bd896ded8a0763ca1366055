Pretoria - State representatives from 15 African countries have concluded the 16th Annual Regional Seminar on International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The seminar was held in Pretoria and was co-hosted by the Department of International Relations and Cooperation and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Participants reflected on the current status of implementation and compliance with IHL in the region, with a particular focus on the theme, Protection of Persons and Property in Times of Armed Conflict. “In plenary meetings, the participants explored the challenges facing IHL worldwide, including the deliberate targeting of civilians, indiscriminate attacks against health care facilities, the intentional destruction of cultural property and heritage as well as persistent attacks against humanitarian aid workers,” a joint statement issued on Friday after the meeting said. The panel discussions also explored how the occurrence of similar acts could be effectively prevented in eastern and southern Africa. “They considered the legal framework and humanitarian consequences of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas; how to enhance the protection of cultural property and heritage in armed conflict; as well as emerging steps to strengthen the protection of health care personnel, equipment and facilities during armed conflict,” read the statement. The meeting reaffirmed its commitment to existing international laws and norms governing the protection of persons and property in times of armed conflict. Participants pledged to identify domestic, regional and continental approaches that could be used to realise the full implementation and enforcement of these obligations. The seminar brought together government representatives from Angola, Botswana, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe, as well as representatives from the Pan-African Parliament, African Union Commission and Southern African Development Community (SADC) Secretariat. - SAnews.gov.za
