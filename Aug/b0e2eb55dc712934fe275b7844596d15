Pretoria - Government has not yet made a pronouncement on the 2017 universities fees and has called for patience to prevail until then. Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande said government is currently gathering further views and suggestions from all stakeholders, including students and university councils, before proceeding with any announcement on the matter. “Given the competing views on fee adjustments, it is indeed imperative that we get as broad a consensus as possible regarding 2017 fees. “The false claims that government has already pronounced itself on the matter are thus not only mischievous but highly prejudicial to the delicate stakeholder engagements that are taking place,” Minister Nzimande said on Sunday. He called for patience from all stakeholders in this regard. Minister Nzimande said he would also continue to consult with his Cabinet colleagues on the matter in an earnest endeavour to find long-term solutions. The plea from government comes as class boycotts are looming at the 27 centres of higher learning and universities countrywide as students reject attempts to increase fees. The Council for Higher Education has proposed a 6% hike for next year and Treasury has warned that another fee freeze will put enormous pressure on state resources. - SAnews.gov.za
