Pretoria – Voting proceedings are on track in the Free State, despite the inclement weather. The IEC in the province, which houses the country’s judicial capital in Bloemfontein, said on Wednesday afternoon that voting generally went smoothly, despite a few hiccups. “It was all systems go this morning, as all voting stations for all 18 local municipalities and one metro opened on time (7am). Things so far have gone smoothly,” IEC Free State spokesperson Mmathabo Rasengane said. Logistics for the country’s fifth Municipal Elections in the province are in place with all the necessary materials having being dispatched to local offices and voting districts on time. Just before 5pm, Rasengane said 175 367 voters had cast their votes in the country’s fifth Municipal Elections. Rasengane said some stations did not open on time, while in some cases, voters took selfies while still inside voting stations and posted them on social media. The weather was also precarious, especially in the eastern part of the province where heavy rains fell. “Due to the weather, some tents [used as voting stations] are falling and this is affecting the voting process,” Rasengane said. Meanwhile, a voting station in Matjhabeng municipality and Thabo Mofutsanyane experienced power outages. “We encourage voters to come out to exercise their democratic rights by casting their votes,” said Rasengane. On Tuesday, North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo expressed confidence that elections in the province will go ahead smoothly, adding that the right to vote is fully recognised as a fundamental right that must not be taken for granted. – SAnews.gov.za
