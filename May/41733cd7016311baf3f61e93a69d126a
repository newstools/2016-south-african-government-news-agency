Pretoria –The South African Local Government Association (SALGA) is busy preparing a councillor training programme and updating the Councillor Induction Manual to focus attention on the Back to Basics programme. Speaking at a two-day Special National Members Assembly (NMA) at the Boardwalk Casino, in Port Elizabeth, on Thursday, Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen said the department appreciates SALGA’s efforts in working towards a smooth transition after the local government elections. The assembly comes a few months before the 2016 municipal elections. “SALGA has proved to be a dynamic and valuable role-player in the local government sphere. Let us continue in that spirit to foster our relationship,” said the Minister. The Association said the assembly provides an opportunity to reflect on the role local government has played in the delivery of services, as well as the key challenges that are yet to be addressed. “The two-day assembly will allow SALGA to focus on progress made in transforming the local government sector,” said the association. The association said the Back to Basics approach has been widely accepted by all stakeholders in government and positive results are already showing. “This is a collective responsibility that requires collective action. Communities can help us to build better municipalities. “All South Africans should work with municipalities to ensure that facilities are maintained, are in good condition, and are being used appropriately. “Vandalism and destruction of infrastructure deprives communities of services that can better their lives,” said the association. It said communities must stand together and protect their infrastructure and facilities. “Responsible citizens must pay for municipal services. The participation of communities and individuals assists government in building strong and capable municipalities,” it said. - SAnews.gov.za
